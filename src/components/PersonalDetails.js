     Hi, my name is <b>Benjamin</b>, and I'm an android developer. I started my journey back in 2010. My first code wasnâ€™t an android application; I began with my own android custom OS. However, in 2012, I had to write an app, and that's when I delved into android application development. It was love at first sight.
Since then, I've not only learned how to create android applications but also continually learn new rules and laws every day.
My life quote may be familiar to you. I encountered it while going to the gym:
<p id='motto-text'><b>'Go hard or go home.'</b></p>
For me, this means striving to be the best in the field you've chosen to pursue.
Moreover, I am very committed to Clean Code. I often say, 'The Clean Code book is next to my bible.' Let me share a quote with you:
<p id='motto-text'><b>''Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.'</b><br/> - Martin Fowler.</p>

  
      </p>
    </div>

}

export default PersonalDetails;
